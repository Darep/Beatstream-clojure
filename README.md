# Beatstream Clojure

**A work-in-progress** Clojure-based implementation of the
[Beatstream](http://www.beatstream.fi/) backend (REST API).

**What?** Yup. I figured I'd learn Clojure, so I thought, I might aswell see
what Beatstream would be like on Clojure. With all the power of Java behind it,
roar.

Check out the current "stable" project at
[https://github.com/Darep/Beatstream](https://github.com/Darep/Beatstream)

### Usage

Requirements: Clojure and [leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen).

Download the source and run `lein ring server` to start the development server.

### HELP!

Hey, you there! If you know Clojure, and see that **I suck,
[please add a comment](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-commit-comments)**
near the bad code in GitHub! Even better, you can tell me why I suck. Or
[create a pull request](https://github.com/Darep/Beatstream-clojure/compare/)!

### Installation

Whoa, there. This is a work in progress. No instructions, yet! Sorry!
