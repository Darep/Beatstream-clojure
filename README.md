# Beatstream Clojure

A work-in-progress Clojure-based implementation of the
[Beatstream](http://www.beatstream.fi/) backend (REST API).

**What?** Yup. I figured I'd learn Clojure, so I thought, I might aswell see
what Beatstream would be like on Clojure. With all the power of Java behind it,
roar.
